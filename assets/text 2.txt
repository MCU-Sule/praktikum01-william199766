That Power, Itâ€™s Not Completely Awful.

Giant Leaps Will Always Come At A Cost.

Eyes. Lungs. Pancreas. So Many Snacks, So Little Time.

You Cannot Just Go Around Eating Anybody You Want To.

God Has Abandoned Us. He Didn't Keep His End Of The Bargain.

No! You Do Not Touch Him. He Is My Friend.

Have A Nice Life.

We Are Venom.
